# Project Title
This is where the title goes. <br>
- *Note: Make it clear yet succinct - don't leave it up to interpretation what your code is or does.*

# Description
This is where you talk about generally what a program does/is meant to do. <br\>
- *Note: This is a general description. The function of the rest of your code can be explained below.*

# Tools Used
This is where you list IDEs, such as Spyder, Intellij, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, etc. <br\>
- *Note: Include the languages in which you used, and what pre-installed dependencies/modules (if any) need to be installed for your code to work.*

# Files Used
This is where dependent files will be listed, as well as their file datatype and purpose for the general code. <br\>
- *Note: Dependencies are very important here! There order of which and how they're incorporated is important to clarify.*
- *Note: If they can't understand how one begins to use the program, it could lead to them overlooking you or your work.*

# How to Run The Program
This is instructions for any interviewers or recruiters to run and utilize your code. <br\>
- *Note: The above two are very important for achieving this in the manner of getting to this part.*
- *Note: This is the overall instructions when it's time to perform the program's function, not the preparation to get what you need to run the program.*

# Additional Information:
Any additional notes or comments regarding the overall project or it's various updates.
- Note: *Typically, this is the best spot for metacommentary, though your comments can achieve this too depending on your purpose. Bottom line, explain yourself.*

# Formatting

## Text
Italics = Wrap in 1 asterisk: *italic*
Bold = Wrap in 2 asterisks: **bold**
Bolded Italics = Wrap in 3 asterisks: ***bold italics***
Strikethrough = Wrap in 2 tildes: ~~Strikethrough~~


## Wrapping
Quoted Text = Put a right karat in front of desired text: 
> Quoted Text <br\>

Paragraph Quote = Like python, wrap lines in three single quotes
'''
Quoted 1
Quoted 2
Quoted 3
'''

## Special

Link = Wrap text in square brackets, then link in parenthesis next to it: [Link Here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
- *Note: You can do the same with headings/subheadings in the README file itself*

Lists = Using either numbers (1, 2, 3) or symbols (*, +, -) to break up lines:
1. A
2. B
3. C

Nested Lists = When making a list, indent with a tab and use an dash below your value to indicate indentation.
- 1
  - 2
    - 3

Footnotes = At the end of a line in need of a footnode add an up karat and a number in square brackets. <br\>
Then, once you have that at the end of the line you need, create a seperate line starting with that and a colon to create your explanation.:

Lorem Ipsum Docet[^1]

[^1]: This is a latin filler string that represents nothing in particular.
