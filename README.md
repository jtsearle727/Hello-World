# Hello-World
This Repository is a test for the class known as 'BAIS Professional Preparation'.

The following are the base entries relevant to the creation of future repositories for this GitHub:

1. Project Title
2. Description
3. Tools Used
4. Files Used
5. How to Run The Program
6. Additional Information

# Project Title
This is where the title goes. <br>
- *Note: Make it clear yet succinct - don't leave it up to interpretation what your code is or does.*

# Description
This is where you talk about generally what a program does/is meant to do. <br>
- *Note: This is a general description. The function of the rest of your code can be explained below.*

# Tools Used
This is where you list IDEs, such as Spyder, Intellij, Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code, etc.
- *Note: Include the languages in which you used, and what pre-installed dependencies/modules (if any) need to be installed for your code to work.*

# Files Used
This is where dependent files will be listed, as well as their file datatype and purpose for the general code.
- *Note: Dependencies are very important here! There order of which and how they're incorporated is important to clarify.*
- *Note: If they can't understand how one begins to use the program, it could lead to them overlooking you or your work.*

# How to Run The Program
This is instructions for any interviewers or recruiters to run and utilize your code. <br>
- *Note: The above two are very important for achieving this in the manner of getting to this part.*
- *Note: This is the overall instructions when it's time to perform the program's function, not the preparation to get what you need to run the program.*

# Additional Information:
Any additional notes or comments regarding the overall project or it's various updates.
- Note: Typically, this is the best spot for metacommentary, though your comments can achieve this too depending on your purpose. Bottom line, explain yourself.
